# GUI-Weather-App-using-python
🌦 I'm thrilled to share my latest project: a Weather App, which I developed as the 4th task during my internship with Oasis Infobyte!

🚀 Project Overview: The Weather App allows users to retrieve real-time weather data for any city worldwide, utilizing the powerful OpenWeatherMap API. This API provides access to a wealth of meteorological information, making it easier to obtain accurate weather conditions, temperature, and humidity levels.

🔍 Key Features:

City Search: Users can input a city name to receive current weather details.
Real-Time Data: The app fetches up-to-date information directly from the OpenWeatherMap API, ensuring accurate readings.
User-Friendly Interface: Built using Python, the app runs in a command-line interface for easy interaction.
🌐 About the API: The OpenWeatherMap API is a reliable source for weather data, offering various endpoints for current weather, forecasts, and historical data. In this project, I specifically utilized the current weather data endpoint to retrieve essential metrics, such as:

Temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit)
Humidity levels
Weather descriptions
💡 Learning Experience: Working on this project helped me strengthen my skills in Python programming, API integration, and data handling. I gained practical experience in parsing JSON responses and effectively displaying weather information to users.

I'm excited to continue building my portfolio and exploring more projects in the future! If you have any feedback or suggestions, I'd love to hear them!
